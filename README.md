## 🎉✨🎉 Three fun facts about me 🎉✨🎉  

- 🏎️ I once finished [**Out Run**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run) (Arcade) on the original cabinet — no continues, just pure adrenaline  
- ☕ I’m more addicted to coffee than my cluster is to RAM — someone said [**CCSD(T)**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01777)?  
- 🗡️ I read the entire [**Wheel of Time**](https://dragonmount.com/Books/index/) original series (14 books, ~12,000 pages) in iless than 10 months.
